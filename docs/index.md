# Welcome

My name is Josh, and I'm sort of a software engineer. This blog is a place for
me to share technical notes, guides, articles, and whatever else my heart
desires. The information shared here represents my own thoughts, opinions, and
experiences, and does not represent the opinions, positions, ideology, or any
other characteristic of my employer.

Most of what I share here will relate to PowerShell and .NET software
development, especially as it relates to Milestone XProtect VMS products.

## Sort of a software engineer?

I started my career with Milestone Systems in 2006 as a technical support
engineer. I had some prior experience building basic websites using the LAMP
stack (Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL), and did some programming in school using
QBasic and later Visual Basic. I even took CS-101 at Portland Community College
and learned a minute amount of C++. However, I was not actually employed as a
software engineer.

During the course of my job as a technical support engineer, I started learning
Python and made some tools to make certain aspects of the job easier and more
consistent. Later, I learned C# so that I could better understand how to use
our SDK which is based on .NET Framework. This also made it significantly
easier to look at our product source code and understand how certain elements
really worked -- or rather, why they _didn't_ work under certain circumstances.

One of my first ambitious projects was a tool called XProtect Analyzer. The
goal of that project was to build a tool that could quickly and consistently
identify problems, or _potential_ problems, with a Milestone XProtect
installation. It was self-updating and could update the set of
"test definitions" it used dynamically.

In 2009 I started learning PowerShell and published [MilestonePSTools](https://www.milestonepstools.com) - a
PowerShell module enabling "easy" configuration of, and reporting on Milestone
XProtect VMS installations. In the process of developing this module I fell in
love with PowerShell, and the PowerShell community.

I continue to maintain MilestonePSTools, and as a "Senior Principal Support
Engineer", I have a broad range of additional responsibilities including:

- Advocating for our customers (for every definition of "customer")
- Offering assistance with complex and/or escalated technical support cases
- Offering technical guidance to internal and external customers
- Identifying important areas of improvement
- Occasionally doing technical presentations online or in-person
- Working with our key accounts and project managers on strategic projects
