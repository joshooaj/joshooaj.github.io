## About me

I am a principal engineer with 19 years of experience in "figuring things out" in technical
support, IT, management, and software engineering roles at [Milestone Systems](https://www.milestonesys.com/),
a leading global video management systems software company.

After discovering the joy of using PowerShell in 2019 while building [MilestonePSTools](https://www.milestonepstools.com/),
a commercial module for managing and automating Milestone XProtect software with PowerShell,
connecting with members of the PowerShell & DevOps communities, and a little arm-twisting, I
delivered my first public session at the [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit](https://www.powershellsummit.org/)
in April of '24 titled ["Building Beautiful Documentation"](https://www.joshooaj.com/docs-workshop).

I can be found on Bluesky, GitHub, and LinkedIn as @joshooaj and I am always happy to make
time for conferences, user groups, and members of the community who also made time for me.
